# Neural-Network-Py
 Creating a Neural Network with Back Propagation. Variable amount of Neurons in one hidden layer.
 Uses gradient descent to calculate weights to generate predicted values.
 
 WordsNew.py cleans text data, tokenizes it, then encodes it into a vector. This is the vector
 representation of the sentence in comparison to the vocabulary generated.
 
 The end goal is to eventually create a form of machine translation using these techniques.
